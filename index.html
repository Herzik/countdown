      <h2>Banana!</h2>
      <h4>Bananas are delicious!</h4>
      <p>
        Correctly! It is long, slightly curved, like a crescent, covered with a rather thick yellow
        skin. The fruit itself is soft. Ripe bananas taste very sweet and sugary. At first, the
        banana fruit is almost straight, but when it ripens and the leaves covering it fall, it
        tries to turn towards the warm sun, so it arches and becomes like a crescent. The banana is
        native to South India. It belongs to the oldest cultivated plants of the tropical zone.
        Banana has been cultivated for ten thousand years. One of the first mentions of this fruit
        is found in manuscripts dating back to the 6th century BC. The first banana plantations
        appeared in China in the 2nd century BC.
